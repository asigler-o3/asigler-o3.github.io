I  decided to study software engineering so I can understand how everything works behind a program/ website. I’ve been interested in learning how to code but never really pursued it until recently. I want to use what I learned to develop my own projects in the future that were once just an idea in my notes to actually being a functional website that can be used to make a difference and make things easier for others. Software engineering speaks to me more than other fields of coding because it has some design elements which I have a background in as an artist. Taking this course will introduce me to new ways of approaching and analyzing problems. I’ll also have new skills that I could potentially incorporate into my art pieces someday.
